# Clustering-Model-with-Internal-Validation-
Use K-means and DBSCAN clustering methods to generate clusters and Evaluated the performance of the clustering algorithm using internal validation metrics
In first file "Chainlink.ipynb" generate clusters using DBSCAN algorithm to classify dataset in to 2 different parts.
second file "Task main.ipynb" use to clean main dataset of world indicators csv file and after applying clustering algorithm we check F-1 score and silhoute score to check that our
clustering number is right or not and got 62% and 44% accuracy in this task.
